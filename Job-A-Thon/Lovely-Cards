/*Lovely Cards
Accuracy: 44.76%Submissions: 12K+Points: 25
Geek has a deck of N cards, each card has a number on it which is represented by an integer array Cards. 
He wants to know if his deck is lovely or not.
A deck of cards is lovely if any arrangement of the cards could always be sorted by swaping any 2 cards 
such that the sum of the 2 cards is always odd. Also you can infinitely swap any 2 cards if their sum is odd. 

If the Geek's cards are lovely, return 1 else return 0.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
Cards = {2, 2, 4}
Output: 0
Explanation: Although the cards are sorted, but the arrangement {4, 2, 2} could never be sorted using 
the good operations. The cards are not lovely.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
Cards = {2, 1, 4}
Output: 1
Explanation: Although the cards are not sorted, but all the arrangements (including this) 
coulbe sorted using finite number of good operations. The cards are therefore lovely.
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anyhting. Your task is to complete the function lovelyCards() which 
takes array Cards and integer N as input parameter and returns the boolean answer if the deck is lovely or not. */
